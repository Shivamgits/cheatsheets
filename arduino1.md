Welcome to Arduino! Before you start controlling the world around you, you'll need to set up the software to program your board.

The Arduino Software (IDE) allows you to write programs and upload them to your board. In the Arduino Software page you will find two options:

If you have a reliable Internet connection, you should use the online IDE (Arduino Web Editor). It will allow you to save your sketches in the cloud, having them available from any device and backed up. You will always have the most up-to-date version of the IDE without the need to install updates or community generated libraries.

If you would rather work offline, you should use the latest version of the desktop IDE.

Code online on the Arduino Web Editor
To use the online IDE simply follow these instructions. Remember that boards work out-of-the-box on the Web Editor, you only need to install Arduino Create Agent to get started.

Install the Arduino Desktop IDE
To get step-by-step instructions select one of the following link accordingly to your operating system.

Windows

Mac OS

Linux

Portable IDE (Windows and Linux)

ChromeOS (Arduino Create App) in the Chrome Web Store

Choose your board in the list here on the right to learn how to get started with it and how to use it on the Desktop IDE.

Learn Arduino
Read an introduction on what is Arduino and why you'd want to use it.

What is the Arduino Software (IDE) and how do I change the default language?

Libraries: Using and installing Arduino Libraries.

Cores: Need to add a new board to your Arduino Software? Install the relate core and manage it.

Troubleshooting: Advice on what to do if things don't work.

For a complete list of Guides visit the Foundations section, where you will find in-depth knowledge about the principles and techniques behind the Arduino platform.

Making the Arduino StarterKit projects and reading the book 'Getting Started with Arduino' are great ways to start learning and tinkering with coding and electronics.
